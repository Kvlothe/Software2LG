How to use : User name: Admin, Password: admin

-- any user with a name and password can use the application. I was testing using 3 different users to make sure things worked. Which ties into my additional report. Because I was using playing around with multiple users for logging in. I chose to show a bar graph with which user had how many appointments compared to other users. I chose this because a similar question was asked to me at work and being able to see who is more active than others or who is possibly more avaliable to do other tasks could be useful to employers. I also added the logs for login_activity on the reports page because it made sense as it is in a way a report.
